# Capstop Project
This is my final project for Front End Developer Nanodegree Program.

## How it works
- Enter the city you wish to find.
- Enter a date or not!
- It should return the city along with a six day weather forcast with icons to help you.
- It will also display the lat, and lon of the city with the population as well.

## What I used
- I used Bootstrap to help me with some layouts. But the weather display I used flex to help show my CSS skills.

## Stand outs that I added
- Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities).
- Instead of just pulling a single day forecast, pull the forecast for multiple days.
- Incorporate icons into forecast.
